<h1>Java-Game</h1>
My first game written in Java.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Spacebar to fire.</br>
Arrow keys to move.

<h2>Notes</h2>
I only implemented 8 levels, but it's easy to add more.</br>
The rarity of the power-ups can also be changed easily.

<h2>Power-ups</h2>
Color|Effect
-----|------
Small Yellow | Power
Big Yellow | Double Power
White | Slow down enemies
Pink | Extra life (rare)
