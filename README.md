<h1>Java-Game</h1>
My first game written in Java.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<br>Spacebar to fire.</br><br>
Arrow keys to move.

<h2><u>Notes</u></h2>

The rarity of the power-ups can also be changed easily.

Color|Effect
-----|------
Small Yellow | Power
Big Yellow | Double Power
White | Slow down enemies
Pink | Extra life (rare)
